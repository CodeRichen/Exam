traditional 2-dimensional array representation:

Transpose time: 0.0004 ms
0 0 1 1 0 0 
0 2 0 0 0 0 
4 0 3 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 
becomes
0 0 4 0 0 
0 2 0 0 0 
1 0 3 0 0 
1 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 

“Transpose” method in the textbook:

Transpose time: 0.0005 ms
(3, 0, 1) becomes (0, 3, 1) in the transpose
(2, 0, 1) becomes (0, 2, 1) in the transpose
(1, 1, 2) becomes (1, 1, 2) in the transpose
(0, 2, 4) becomes (2, 0, 4) in the transpose
(2, 2, 3) becomes (2, 2, 3) in the transpose

“FastTranspose” method in the textbook:

Transpose time: 0.0007 ms
(0, 2, 4) becomes (2, 0, 4) in the transpose
(1, 1, 2) becomes (1, 1, 2) in the transpose
(2, 0, 1) becomes (0, 2, 1) in the transpose
(2, 2, 3) becomes (2, 2, 3) in the transpose
(3, 0, 1) becomes (0, 3, 1) in the transpose
